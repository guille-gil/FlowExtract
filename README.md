Official repository for the (submitted) APMS 2026 paper: **"FlowExtract: Procedural Knowledge Extraction from Maintenance Flowcharts"**.

## Overview

Maintenance procedures in manufacturing facilities are often documented as flowcharts in static PDFs or scanned images. These documents encode procedural knowledge essential for asset lifecycle management but remain inaccessible to modern operator support systems. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to reconstruct complex connection topologies from such diagrams, **FlowExtract** offers a robust, hybrid alternative.

FlowExtract is a pipeline that deliberately separates element detection from connectivity reconstruction:
1. **Node Detection**: Single-stage object detection (YOLOv8s) localized and classified symbols.
2. **Text Extraction**: Deep-learning OCR (EasyOCR) extracts node content.
3. **Edge Extraction**: Classical line-tracing (Hough Transform) derives directed graphs from detected arrowheads.

By focusing on high precision rather than forced recall, FlowExtract is explicitly designed for **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** workflows. The system provides a highly reliable structural skeleton of the standard operating procedure, allowing human validators to efficiently contribute completeness without having to untangle hallucinatory cross-links.

## Key Features & Results

Evaluated on a dataset of real-world ISO 5807-standardized industrial troubleshooting guides, FlowExtract substantially outperforms state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines (such as Qwen2-VL-7B and Pixtral-12B) on graph extraction tasks.

* **Node Detection (F1)**: `98.8%` *(vs best VLM: 34.0%)*
* **Edge Detection (F1)**: `66.7%` *(vs best VLM: 10.7%)*
* **Edge Precision**: `85.5%`

### Qualitative Performance

The pipeline successfully handles dense technical terminology, tightly spaced nodes, and overlapping edges, tracing multi-branching procedural paths accurately.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.9+
* [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) (required by EasyOCR depending on OS)
* MacOS M-series or CUDA-compatible GPU recommended for YOLO inference.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/guille-gil/FlowExtract.git
   cd FlowExtract
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model weights (if hosted externally) and place them in:
   `runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt`

```

## Usage

### 1. Running the Pipeline
To extract a directed graph from a raw flowchart image, run the main entry point:

```bash
python src/main.py
```
This will parse the files in `data/input/images/test/` and output the structural JSON graphs to `data/intermediate/arrows/`.

### 2. Evaluating Metrics
To replicate the evaluation results found in the paper, execute the evaluation script. This will compare the extracted JSON graphs against the `data/input/final_annotations` ground truth:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --charts
```
Evaluation metrics will be printed to stdout, and publication-ready charts (like the ones generated for APMS) will be saved to `data/output/charts/`.
